# Effect Macros
These macros use the [Effect Macros](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/effectmacro/) module. Each file is named after the effect that it is placed on and they all have comments explaining the use and what effect activates the macro. Some macro files are actually multiple macros in one. Make sure to look carefully. If it is multiple macros, the comments will tell you and where to put each macro in an effect. There are several folders for each type of effect. Some effects may look like duplicates, but they are not. For instance a class feature and a monster feature may do the same thing, but they may edit flags differently to allow for multiple of the same monster with different values.
